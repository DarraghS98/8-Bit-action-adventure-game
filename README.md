# PyGame 8 bit Action/Adventure Game

Hi! My project is to create an 8 bit action / adventure game much along the lines of an old school Legend of Zelda.
The game will feature a Single Player mode at first and then branch out to a multiplayer game (hopefully!).
Over the coming months this game will be under development and will be done by the end April.

# Installation
To install download the repo. In requirements.txt you will find all the dependencies. These can be installed using ``pip install pygame``
``pip install pytmx``
requirements.txt contains the dependencies that are required.
Then run main using Python main.py

# SinglePlayer

Singleplayer is the core of the game. It will run through the basics and the more advanced features of what the game has to offer.
Users will progress gaining better equipment and even an option to upgrade some equipment when the option is available.
Levels will get progressively harder including boss fights that will reward the player for beating.
The goal of the Single player mode is for people to get a good grasp of how the game runs and the features it has.

## Endless Mode

Once a player beats the Single Player mode an Endless Mode will be unlocked. This is a mode where endless waves of enemies will chase the player and the player must see how many enemies it can kill before it dies.
Maybe a leaderboard will be created for this?

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer will be the last thing I implement. It will allow people to play the game when the other things get boring. 
More thought and work needs to be put into this. *Still not implemented*

# Summary
This is a project which I will be working on in the next few months. I look forward to any feedback and any way to improve code/game. Check back for updates on the game and how far along everything is coming.
